# Asphalt-Art-Project
# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project makes two painters, one for the background and one for the pokemon, in the end it will look somewhat similar to Zapdos from Pokemon

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things that I am proud of in my project are that I was able to make my own classes and I was able to incorporate an if-else statement two things I thought I'd find difficult

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   -  Something I would do differently would probably be I would like to make an even more detailed one, make it more difficult if I could, but I feel like I would not do too well because I still have trouble sometimes with certain things.
